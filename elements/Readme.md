# React Elements #

HTML is simply a set of instructions that a browser follows when
constructing the DOM. The elements that make up an HTML
document become DOM elements when the browser loads HTML and
renders the user interface.

The DOM API is a collection of objects that JavaScript can use to
interact with the browser to modify the DOM. If you’ve used
document.createElement or document.appendChild, you’ve
worked with the DOM API

React is a library that’s designed to update the browser DOM for us.
We no longer have to be concerned with the complexities associated
with building high-performing SPAs because React can do that for us.
With React, we do not interact with the DOM API directly. Instead, we
provide instructions for what we want React to build, and React will
take care of rendering and reconciling the elements we’ve instructed it
to create.
