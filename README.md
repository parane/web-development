## CSS Modules ##
CSS Modules is a CSS file in which all class and animation names are scoped locally by default. This means that the styles defined in a CSS Module are scoped to the component they are imported into, preventing conflicts with other styles in the application.
Key Features
Scoped Styles: Styles are scoped to the component, preventing conflicts.
Dynamic Class Names: Class names are dynamically generated to ensure uniqueness.
Maintainability: Easier to maintain as styles are co-located with components.

Global Styles: Managing global styles can be more complex.
Tooling: Requires build tools like Webpack to process CSS Modules.
Dynamic Styling: Less flexible for dynamic styling compared to CSS-in-JS.

## CSS in JS ##

CSS-in-JS is a styling technique where CSS is written within JavaScript files. This approach allows for more dynamic and scoped styling, often used in modern JavaScript frameworks like React. Here are some key points:

Key Features
**Scoped Styles**: Styles are scoped to components, preventing conflicts.
**Dynamic Styling**: Styles can be dynamically generated based on component props or state.
**Theming**: Easy to implement theming by passing theme objects.
**Maintainability**: Styles are co-located with components, making it easier to maintai

Popular libraries include 
  1. styled component
  2. Emotion 

### Styled Components
The styled-component is popular library for styling react componets. It allows you to erite plain css with your js and attach it to componets

### Emotion 
Emotion is another popular library for styling react components. It provides powerful styling features like nested selectors, global styles, and theming.

We ll see more depth during react 


Issues:
Performance: Can introduce runtime performance overhead.
Tooling: Requires additional libraries and tooling.
Learning Curve: May have a steeper learning curve for developers familiar with traditional CSS.
